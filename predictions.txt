predictions

change pab levels -> levels of chaperone during heat shock recovery
predictions about extended heat shock between competing hyptheses -> mRNA degradation vs. Pab binding

Delineate hypotheses - can both explain observed phenomenon?

If so (or even if not), what happens when we change the regime of the shock? Is there a testable difference between the 

Can we make predictions based on the amount of Pab available? "Easy" to titrate both in vivo and in vitro.

Levels of chaperone induction.







does the density of the bulk cytosol change during heat shock?

what happens to cells when you heat them infinitely slowly?

can you predict the pellet?

can you predict assembly?
